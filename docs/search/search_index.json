Operator Configuration Sample configuration can be found in operator-config.yaml All the configuration must be specified under spec or config Supported configurations under spec replicas : Number of replicas of typesense. default : 3 NOTE : When the number of replicas are increased the operator automatically handles the peering connection between the replicas. namespace : Namespace to be used for deployment. default : typesense image : Typesense production ready docker image. List can be found here . default : latest tag will be pulled resources : Resources for cpu and memory. default resources: requests: memory: 100Mi cpu: \"64m\" limits: memory: 256Mi cpu: \"512m\" nodeSelector : Node to which pod has to be scheduled. if not specified, it picks up the node with available resources storageClass : Provides a way to administor the storage. Create a storage class with the provider of your choice and add it to the operator config. Options available are name and size name : Name of the storageClass that the operator should consider for volume mount. size : Size of the volume to be allocated to each typesense replica. NOTE : Supports all k8s Storageclass . startupProbe : Protect slow starting containers with startup probes Options available are failureThreshold and periodSeconds NOTE : k8s startupProbe . livenessProbe : Kubernetes provides liveness probes to detect and remedy such situations. Options available are failureThreshold and periodSeconds NOTE : k8s livenessProbe . Supported configurations under config secret : Typesense authentication is done using a password which is stored as secret.
